[00:00.78] And I know you think you can run
[00:03.65] You're scared to believe I'm the one
[00:06.22] But I just can't let you go
[00:19.72] 
[00:11.81] I'd let the world burn
[00:14.22] Let the world burn for you
[00:16.89] This is how it always had to end
[00:19.88] If I can't have you, then no one can
[00:22.55] I'd let it burn, I'd let the world burn
[00:27.44] Just to hear you calling out my name
[00:30.21] Watchin' it all go down in flames
[00:46.71] 
[00:33.35] So, let the world burn
[00:37.50] Let the world burn for you, let the world burn for you
[00:42.68] Let the world burn, burn, burn
[00:47.86] I'd let the world burn
[00:50.98] Watching it all go down in flames
[01:07.48] 
[00:54.24] Fear in their eyes
[00:57.58] Ash rainin' from the blood orange sky
[01:02.72] I let everybody know that you're mine
[01:08.15] Now it's just a matter of time
[01:23.15] 
[01:13.56] And I know you think you can run
[01:15.71] You're scared to believe I'm the one
[01:18.25] But I just can't let you go
[01:31.75] 
[01:23.55] I'd let the world burn
[01:26.43] Let the world burn for you
[01:29.08] This is how it always had to end
[01:32.24] If I can't have you, then no one can
[01:34.80] I'd let it burn, I'd let the world burn
[01:39.82] Just to hear you calling out my name
[01:42.44] Watchin' it all go down in flames
[01:45.08] Let it all burn
[01:49.75] Oh, I'd burn this world for you
[01:54.63] Oh, baby, I'd let it burn for you
[02:11.13] 
[02:05.03] I'd let the world burn
